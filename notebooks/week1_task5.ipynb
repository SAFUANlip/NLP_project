She said the Australian strawberry industry experienced similar success with an almost 30 per cent rise in export volume and a 26 per cent rise in value to $32.6M over the same period.\n",
            "\u201cAustralian berry sectors are in a firm position at the moment,\u201d she said. \u201cProduction, adoption of protected substrate cropping, improved genetics and an expanding geographic footprint have all helped put Aussie berries on a positive trajectory.\n",

The strongest short-term trade options identified for the strawberry sector were Thailand, Malaysia, New Zealand and Macau.\n",
            "The strategy focuses heavily on growing the existing strawberry export market from 4 per cent to at least 8 per cent of national production by volume, in markets with a capacity and willingness to pay a premium for quality fruit. For raspberries and blackberries, the sectors aim to achieve a 5 per cent boost in exports assessed by volume across identified markets by 2021.\n",

There was a degree of trade expansion in the five decades to World War I but, until the late 20th century, interactions across continents involved little more than the exporting of vine cuttings and traditional production expertise. Indeed most wine was consumed in the country of production, and those countries were mostly in Europe.\n",
            "The fall in transport and communication costs since the 1980s is largely responsible for the change. That has made it affordable for many more producers to focus on exports, and for some to also focus on mergers or acquisitions.\n",
            "Falling international trade costs and de-regulation of liquor retailing have also allowed large supermarket chains to become buyers of both bottled or bag-in-box wines and wine for building their own brands.\n",
            "Retailing through such chain stores requires large quantities of homogenous wine year after year. Producers in the New World were more adept at initially responding to this new demand, creating a huge new category of robust, fruity \u2018commercial premium\u2019 wines that fall between expensive fine wines and cheap non-premium (\u2018table\u2019) wines.\n",
            "The share of global wine production exported, which had always been below 15 per cent and mostly Mediterranean or intra-European, grew dramatically from the late 1980s. By 2012 it exceeded 40 per cent.\n",
            "The New World\u2019s share of global wine exports rose from 3 per cent in the late 1980s to 25 per cent (if sparkling wine is excluded) by 2004.\n",
            "Recognizing their poor performance, Europe\u2019s producers during the past decade have been adapting their practices to compete. The three leading European wine-exporting countries as a group now export almost half their production, up from just one-fifth a generation ago.\n",
            "Simultaneously, New World producers are seeking to expand their exports of more-expensive wines to complement their lower-end products. The next phase of wine\u2019s globalization therefore may involve a convergence whereby both groups produce terroir-driven super-premium wines alongside more-affordable \u2018commercial premium\u2019 branded wines. Meanwhile, cheap basic non-premium wines are continuing their demise.\n",
            "Technological developments are rapidly altering the means of exporting commercial premium wines. In the past decade or so the share of wine that is exported from the New World in bulk shipping containers has risen from less than 15 to more than 40 percent. Bottling in the country of destination is sometimes cheaper, and it lowers the cost and carbon footprint of shipping. By shipping in 24,000-litre bladders to fit 20-foot containers, this new technology offers greater opportunities to blend wines from any region of the world.\n",
            "Greater openness to trade means winemakers and hence grapegrowers are far more exposed now than pre-1990 to exchange rate volatility, and also to greater import competition in their domestic market as consumers seek to choose from an ever-broader range of wines. Wide fluctuations in exchange rates since the global financial crisis began in 2008 have substantially altered national shares in key markets.\n",
            "Greater openness and international travel also alter tastes and preferences. Nowhere has this been more obvious in the case of wine than in China. Chinese wine imports grew more than 50 percent per year during 2006-12. With the number of middle class in China currently around 250 million and growing at 10 million per year, and with grape wine accounting for less than 5 percent of alcohol consumption, further large increases in wine consumption are expected. How much of that Chinese demand will be supplied by domestic producers is difficult to guess, but import growth is likely to continue for the foreseeable future (see Wittwer and Anderson 2015).\n",

            "Ingredients\n",
            "Spring water from Norwich originates in an underground water source (spring or bore hole) and Drench is apparently bottled at source.\n",
            "Fruit juices are grape juice 6%, cranberry juice 1%, and raspberry juice 1%, all of which are natural.\n",
            "Sugar is no longer seen as a healthy food but it does provide sweetness and energy. It is now being used to make biofuels by fermenting it to form ethanol (C2H5OH, aka alcohol) and a plant is being built in Hull to convert the UK's sugar beet crop into a second generation biofuel called biobutanol (C4H9OH) which can be blended with petrol better and it delivers more energy per molecule.\n",
            "Citric acid (aka E330 chemical formula C6H8O7 with three acid groupings). This is produced naturally by citrus fruits but is now more cheaply manufactured by fermenting starch with the fungus Aspergillus niger. It gives the drink added tanginess and acts as a preservative.\n",
            "Citric acid is used in surface cleaners to remove limescale and is particularly recommended for cleaning glass surfaces. It is added to products that are designed to fizz when added to water. The explosive HMTD (hexamethylene triperoxide diamine) is made from citric acid.\n",
            "Natural flavourings are unspecified but the molecules which give fruits their characteristic aromas are known and can be purchased as individual chemicals. Those present in raspberry are 1-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-3-butanone, cis-3-hexene-1-ol, damascenone, ?-ionone, and ?-ionone, while those in cranberries they are ethyl-2-methylbutyrate, ethyl-3-methylbutryate, and trans-2-hexenal.\n",
            "Some of these chemicals are also manufactured and used in perfumes. For example, ?-ionone provides a sweet violet odour while ?-ionone provides one that is reminiscent of cedar wood.\n",
            "Anthocycanin (aka E163) is a food colorant and these types of molecules, of which there are several, are found in nature and give petals their red, blue or purple colours, and are designed to attract pollinating insects like bees. (The colour depends to a certain extent on acidity.)\n",
            "Anthocyanins also acts as powerful antioxidants and are a key part of fruits such as red grapes, blueberries, and raspberries, which is why these are thought to be particularly beneficial. Anthocyanins also have potential for use in solar cells, the so-called dye-sensitive solar cells.\n",
            "Potassium sorbate (aka E202) is a powerful preservative and used in foods and drinks. It is a highly effective fungicide that interferes with the reproductive capabilities of moulds and yeasts.\n",
            "Dimethyl dicarbonate (C4H6O5) consists of two methyl carbonate molecules (CH3OC(O)OC(O)OCH3) joined together via a common oxygen atom. This molecule acts as a preservative, especially for drinks, by disabling enzymes in microbes like yeasts which can cause spoilage. It is now being added to wines in place of sulfur dioxide to which some people are sensitive.\"\n",

Broad industry interest and a strong commercial appetite for export market development combined with the potential to capitalise on existing trade agreements and build new trade partnerships has created this perfect environment for growth.\u201d\n",
            "High-income countries across Europe, North America and Northern Asia have been identified as having a palate for Australian grown berries with more than 4244 tonnes of fresh berries exported in the last financial year alone.\n",
            "The strategy identified the best short-term prospect markets for the Australian blackberry and raspberry industry as Hong Kong, Singapore, The United Arab Emirates and Canada. The strongest short-term trade options identified for the strawberry sector were Thailand, Malaysia, New Zealand and Macau.\n",
            "The strategy focuses heavily on growing the existing strawberry export market from 4 per cent to at least 8 per cent of national production by volume, in markets with a capacity and willingness to pay a premium for quality fruit. For raspberries and blackberries, the sectors aim to achieve a 5 per cent boost in exports assessed by volume across identified markets by 2021.\n",
            "Tasmanian raspberry exporter Nic Hansen said Australia offers some of the sweetest and most attractive berries in the world, and this combined with our stringent food safety standards across all stages of the supply chain puts growers in a solid position.\n",
            "\u201cWe have a great product, we are hungry to expand trade and now with this new plan in place, we have a clear roadmap towards driving growth,\u201d Mr Hansen said.\n",
            "He said it is exciting to see new export market prospects for raspberries: \u201cThe more options we have for export the better. Now we just have to get on with the job of ensuring industry has all the tools it needs, such as supporting data and relationship building opportunities, to thrive in new markets.\u201d\n",
            "This project was commissioned by Hort Innovation, and developed by market analysts and research consultants Auspex Strategic Advisory and AgInfinity. Hort Innovation will work now with berry sectors to determine levy-funded activities to support trade.\n",
            "See a summary of the strategy on the Hort Innovation website.\n",
