You can run an A/B test to measure the performance of many different parts of your sales funnel, including your email campaigns, landing pages, ad campaigns and more. And a few hours of work could lead to big boosts in conversions, revenue, and more.\\nYou can use split-testing to optimize your sales funnel.\\nSo what is split testing anyways? Basically, you will test two or more different versions of your campaign or asset. Let\\u2019s say you want to A/B test your landing page. You might set up one landing page with a call-to-action (CTA) that says \\u201cClick here to learn how to increase your ecommerce sales!\\u201d and another CTA that states \\u201cClick Here to Enjoy a Free Trial!\\u201d then measure which one performs better.\\nIdeally, when you A/B test something, you change only one thing between the two versions. So when split testing the call to action, you won\\u2019t change around images, buttons, or anything else. Your goal is to determine exactly what is causing performance to increase (or decrease).\\nExample of a simple A/B test. Notice the different click buttons.\\nIf you change multiple elements at once, it\\u2019ll be hard (if not impossible) to determine which one is causing the change. By testing only one thing at a time, you can hone in on changes that are making a difference.\\nHowever, in order to determine whether something is having an impact or not, you need to gather a lot of data. We\\u2019re not talking about dozens of clicks, but instead thousands or even tens of thousands. If you test every individual word change and element individually, it can be difficult to collect enough data.\\nLet\\u2019s say you want to try a new CTA and you want to know the impact of this CTA and button throughout your entire sales funnel. You can do this with a multi-page A/B test. You will simply apply the new CTA at every relevant stage of your funnel.\\nThe orange \\u201cGet Started for Free\\u201d button is an example of a CTA from PayKickstart\\u2019s site.\\nMost sales funnels feature multiple pages, and most pages will offer you an opportunity to use your CTA. You can set up two funnels, one with the old CTA, another with the new CTA, and then test the performance of each sales funnel on the whole.\\nCustomers are going to progress through each phase of your funnel. You can split test different steps of this funnel to see how each step is performing. For example, you could test one version of a landing page. Then when the customer clicks on the first link and goes to the product info page, you can A/B test that product info page as well.\\nNext, the customer might check out with the product. Here again, you can A/B test the shopping cart to see what features, tools, or language is working best. In this case, a single customer interaction allows you to test multiple things at once. However, since you are A/B testing individual pages against one another, you can still hone in on what is producing results and what\\u2019s not.\\nIf you\\u2019re thinking about a huge shake-up, say changing your entire marketing language or the overall feel of your brand, testing simply a logo change or a call-to-action might not be enough. Instead, you can A/B test your entire approach to see if the radical shake-up will produce results.\\nSo if you design a whole new website with a more modern look and more aggressive copy, you could A/B test that against your old website. If results are negative, your branding shift might not work. In this case, you may want to try to hone in on what\\u2019s causing the drop in performance.\\nCheck out the redesigns to Yahoo!\\u2019s homepage. It\\u2019d be hard to test each individual element.\\nSo maybe you go back and adjust your calls-to-action to make them less aggressive. At the same time, you could test your new, modern looking website with less aggressive language. If the results are positive and you start producing more conversions, now you have good reason to believe that the updated website is a boon but the aggressive language is not.\\nWant to test a number of variables at once? It is possible, especially if you have a lot of traffic. Keep in mind that the testing itself might not be quite as accurate as A/B testing a single variable. However, let\\u2019s be honest, if you want to test a large number of individual variables, you may not have enough time to A/B test every single one.\\nIMDb changed a lot of elements in the two above websites. It would take a long time to test each variable separately.\\nWith multivariate testing, you can swap a number of variables. The trick is to test every possible combination to see which ones work best and which ones are performing worse. If you have a common element turns up in your lowest performing ones, say a certain purchase button or CTA, you can take an educated guess and surmise that the specific element is lowering performance.\\nLikewise, if certain elements turn up consistently in your best-performing variations, there\\u2019s a good chance that these elements are improving performance. You can hone down your tests, dropping the worst performing combinations and elements until you end up with your best performing combination of variables.\\nSplit Testing takes commitment. You\\u2019re going to need to test a considerable amount of traffic to gather enough data to uncover meaningful insights. And a proper split testing campaign can take weeks, if not months to complete.\\nThis is especially true if you want to test a variety of elements. Still, the payoff will ultimately worth it. Using data, you should be able to increase your sales and conversions.\",\n          \"Asia's major oil consuming nations have decided to release crude oil from their respective strategic petroleum reserves in coordinated efforts with the US to ease the price burden on Asia Pacific consumers, but some of the top Asian economies believe there are more effective ways to tame consumer inflation such as lowering fuel taxes.\\nNot registered?\\nReceive daily email alerts, subscriber notes & personalize your experience.Register Now\\nIndia, China, South Korea and Japan said they plan to release their state oil reserves after the White House announced Nov. 23 that the US will release 50 million barrels from its SPR early next year.\\nIndia has agreed to release 5 million barrels of crude oil from its SPR, while China is poised to release more crude from state reserves amid expectations that the second set of auctions could potentially include at least 7 million barrels of medium sweet ESPO blend crude.\\nSouth Korea will release crude from its SPR, with a source at the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy indicating that Seoul could offer about 3.8 million barrels.\\nJapan will also sell part of the country's national petroleum reserves. Tokyo's sales of national petroleum reserves will be made by advancing its planned sales of crude oil grades for replacement in the national petroleum reserves without violating the country's petroleum stockpiling law. The sales could amount to around \\\"a couple of hundred thousand kiloliters,\\\" according to Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Koichi Hagiuda.\\nHowever, the volume of the major Asian economies' SPR releases disappointed global market participants, while New Delhi, Seoul, Beijing and Tokyo and have all failed to provide any timeline for their crude releases so far.\\n\\\"Asia's SPR release was below expectations and it is [even understood to be] an exchange deal... buyers need to return the oil in 2022 to 2024,\\\" a crude trader based in Singapore said.\\nThe combined total of the four nations' crude releases account for only a tiny portion of their SPRs. Many Asian nations are not exactly keen on fully utilizing national reserves, with state-run oil companies and major private refiners in Northeast and Southeast Asia indicating that the true purpose of the SPR is for critical events such as drastic supply disruptions due to major geopolitical events like war, not for commercial reasons like high prices.\\nIn addition, quality concerns could limit demand from Japanese refiners as a large quantity of crude oil in Japan's SPR has been sealed in the same tanks for more than decades, according to refinery and trading sources with close knowledge of the matter.\\nTax cuts, subsidies\\nAuthorities in South Korea and Japan are seeking to implement more constructive ways to tackle the rising consumer inflation and help ease the burden on consumers struggling with high retail fuel prices.\\nEarlier this month, South Korea's Ministry of Economy and Finance decided to lower taxes on auto fuels by as much as 20% for six months from November, as part of efforts to ease rise in pump prices.\\nIn Japan, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry decided to provide subsidies to curb increases in retail prices of gasoline, kerosene, gasoil and fuel oil from the end of December to end of March in an effort to aid domestic transportation fuel consumers.\\nTax cuts and subsidies can effectively and promptly bring prices down for consumers, but it takes months for the big international benchmark price moves to be fully reflected in daily life for the average citizen and retail gas stations, according to middle distillate marketers at Japan's Cosmo Oil and South Korea's S-Oil Corp.\\nOPEC+ hike, not cut\\nOil industry and refinery sources across Asia indicated that although OPEC and its allies are adopting a cautious approach in the group's production strategy, the producers are still raising production, albeit at a slower-than-desired rate.\\nOPEC and its allies are standing firm on increasing crude output quotas by a modest 400,000 b/d each month. In contrast, nine major Asian refiners surveyed by S&P Global Platts -- including PTT, BPCL, ENEOS, SK Innovation, Petronas and PetroChina -- indicated the producer group should ideally raise supply by at least 800,000 b/d as current oil prices appear too high and consumer sentiment is hurt by prices at these levels.\\nHowever, the current market fundamentals are far from what Asian oil and refining industry would classify as a 'state emergency' as the OPEC+ is still looking to raise output and the group is not actually reducing supply, according to trading managers and plant operation managers at the major Asian refiners surveyed.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9590,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Who was responsible for the creation of Social Security and when was it signed into law?\",\n          \"What is the size and price of the smaller signs the author decided to make?\",\n          \"What was the subject of the program given by Suffolk University Law School\\u2019s Intellectual Property section on Monday, February 04, 2019?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9598,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Move My Car has been moving cars from Devonport to Devonport for over 25 years.\",\n          \"The purpose of split testing in marketing campaigns is to increase the performance of various marketing campaigns and the entire sales funnel.

In a way it builds on an earlier literature on the subject, Handbook of Climate Change and India, edited by Dubash and produced in 2011. Much has changed since then; hence this book was borne.\\nDubash, the author of the first chapter (and some later ones) sets the tone right in the beginning when he says: \\u201cDevelopment innocent of climate change negotiations is not an option.\\u201d One aspect that comes across quite clearly is that India is particularly vulnerable to climate change. With rising global mean temperatures melting Himalayan glaciers, kicking up heat waves and making monsoons fickle, India is just a notch above the \\u2018Small Island Developing States\\u2019 , which run the risk of completely disappearing under water if global warming goes on unabated.\\nIn the chapter titled Impact of Climate Change in India, J Srinivasan of the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, notes that India\\u2019s surface temperatures grew by 0.6 per cent between 1901 and 2010, and that glaciers will be gone in 50 years. Area under drought doubled between 1959 and 2009, and will only worsen further. Rainfall, if pulled out of the mask of averages, shows extremes and more uneven distribution. The chapter is also a sort of a primer on climate change \\u2014 it describes what it is all about.\\nOne telling data point is: while the world took 1,000 years to warm up by 1o Celsius after it emerged from the Ice Age 20,000 years ago, it took just the last 120 years for it to warm up by another 1o.\\nIn his paper on the impacts of global warming in India, Nagraj Adve, member, India Climate Justice Collective, New Delhi, gives anecdotal accounts of changes that have occurred due to rising sea levels in the Sunderbans, home to 4.3 million Indians, of whom 1.5 million are \\u2018below poverty line\\u2019.\\nThen comes the section on India in the climate negotiations. The first chapter in this is a 1991 paper written by Sunita Narain and Anil Agarwal of the Centre for Science and Technology, in which the authors speak of \\u2018environment colonialism\\u2019 and stress on the need to distinguish between \\u2018survival emissions\\u2019 and \\u2018luxury emissions\\u2019. Interesting as it is, the chapter is anachronistic.\\nThe distinctions of responsibility between developed and developing countries the authors call for came to be recognised as \\u2018Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities\\u2019 very early on in climate negotiations of the early 1990s and, as the later chapters of the section say, were thrown out of the window by the time of the Paris Agreement.\\nThe subsequent chapters show how India started as an active and aggressive participant in the formulation of climate action in the 1990s, but then went quiet later as it began gyrating towards the US \\u2014 perhaps due to strategic imperative of the post-Pokhran and Nuclear Deal times. Around the Copenhagen talks, India turned into a filibuster, but it lost its footing somewhere between leading developing countries and being counted among the \\u2018big boys\\u2019 of the developing world, and in the end, lost its voice.\\nDiplomat Shyam Saran, the former special envoy of prime minister on climate change, gives an interesting account of that eventful day in December 2009 in Copenhagen, when the then US President Barack Obama personally extracted acquiescence of the leading developing countries, something that triggered a public outburst by the Chinese negotiator, Xie Zhenhua, at his own President, Wen Jibao.\\nIn the later chapters, Shankar Venkateswaran and Mukund Rajan of the Tata group show the growing involvement of the Indian private sector in climate action, particularly in the recent years. They note that while the number of large companies taking action \\u2014 reporting, having a senior \\u2018chief sustainability officer\\u2019, etc \\u2014 is growing, nothing much is happening in the MSME sector. They say while businesses must \\u201creflect on their role in the society\\u201d and not wait for a business-case, it would be unrealistic to expect businesses to embrace sustainability without an external push, such as regulation. Regulation, they note, is confusing \\u2014 for instance, while there is a coal cess on the one hand, on the other, the Coal Ministry wants to increase coal production.\\nThe section on \\u2018policy\\u2019 notes how climate change has not yet entered the consciousness of State governments, as well as the inadequacy of Central funding for State climate actions.\\nRegarding \\u2018climate and development\\u2019, the chapter on forests is particularly insightful. Forests link to one of India\\u2019s commitments under the Paris Agreement, that it would absorb 2.5-3 billion tonnes of CO2 by 2030. The authors, Sharachchandra Lele and Jagdish Krishnaswamy, trace the evolution of forest legislation, essentially the decentralising of forests\\u2019 maintenence by giving it to the local communities.\\nYet in practice, the bureaucracy has been unwilling to give up control. Funds meant for afforestation continue to be used for conventional plantation activities on any land the bureaucracy chooses, notwithstanding the conflict with local communities or participatory forest management. India\\u2019s Paris commitment, the authors say, could end up in further re-centralisation of the effort.\\nOverall, India in a Warming World is a very well-timed book \\u2014 a good reference material for various individual aspects, as each chapter itself is a synthesis of several other reports, papers, news stories and personal interviews of the\",\n          \"It\\u2019s the truth, I\\u2019ve done my research \\u2013 nobody has ever revealed what I\\u2019m going to expose as an internet marketer. Now, some people may hint at it, but I\\u2019ve not come across anyone who has dealt with this in any detail.\\nNow, I may be discounting myself early by saying that most people look at what I\\u2019m going to say as \\u201cOh, I already know that\\u201d. But I\\u2019ll tell you one thing\\u2026 take the things I\\u2019m sharing with you and apply them to your business, you\\u2019ll find that you will have the one thing most internet marketers don\\u2019t have \\u2013 and that\\u2019s clarity.\\nSo what is the shocking truth about making money online? Well, it\\u2019s that people never talk about it as a real project they must complete! Here\\u2019s what\\u2019s happening, you come across all those long salesletters and they talk about how all you need to do is follow their system and all the money you imagine will pop up in your account. The reason why that works so well is because it feeds into your inner lazy man and your greed glands \\u2013 combine the two and you\\u2019ve got a deadweight debilitating thought stuck in your belief system that what you\\u2019re going to buy next will save you from your poverty.\\nIt\\u2019s kind of like a really fat dude sitting on a couch \\u2013 and demanding more chips, more Coke, more service while half-naked, gorging on the huge amounts of junk food in front of him.\\nIt\\u2019s ugly \\u2013 but that\\u2019s how most people are when it comes to Internet Marketing.\\nHow on earth do you really make money? Simple, for only $47, you\\u2019ll get instant access to my proven system.\\nI\\u2019m not going to pitch you now \\u2013 I only want you, dear reader, to \\u201cwake up\\u201d. To stop believing that buying the next shiny, sexy product will do anything for your savings account, except deflating it a little bit.\\nLet\\u2019s say you want to embark on making money online by creating a product, you must want to finish it. And you\\u2019ll need tools and strategies to help you get started and to help you complete it.\\nHow do you get started? You must ask yourself these questions\\u2026\\n- What do I want to reveal in my product \\u2013 does it solve a real need?\\n- When do I want to complete it?\\nThat\\u2019s it. 2 simple questions will get you started. What do you want to do and when you want to finish it. Most people complete the 1st question with ease but when it comes to the 2nd question, they answer with \\u201cas soon as possible\\u201d or \\u201cwhen I get the time to do it\\u201d.\\nAgain, truth be told, that will never happen. Something called Parkinson\\u2019s Law kicks in\\u2026 \\u201cWork expands to fill the time available for its completion\\u201d. If you say it but don\\u2019t set a real deadline, it\\u2019s never going to happen.\\nWhy? If you\\u2019re an internet marketer, I\\u2019m going to assume you are a smart person \\u2013 intellectually. The problem with smart intellectual people is that they know so much they want to incorporate all their knowledge into the thing they\\u2019re working on.\\nSo even though they know what they want and they know what they want to do, they don\\u2019t do it. And that\\u2019s why outsourcing or insourcing helps so much over here \\u2013 you\\u2019re getting someone who doesn\\u2019t know as much as you do, to simply do it. Quite literally, you\\u2019re too smart for your own good.\\nSo get someone else to do the grunt work. Give them the deadline. Not you. Because if you set your deadline on yourself, unless you\\u2019ve got really good self-discipline, you\\u2019re going to move the deadline to a different date. And then, you\\u2019ll just beat yourself over it before you die because you just kept pushing and pushing and pushing it away. You must set a deadline and stick to it.\\nAfter you\\u2019ve determined what you want to create and when you want to finish it, you\\u2019ll then need to get into creating it. You create what you like to do, what\\u2019s interesting to you. Because what you want to create is known only to you, you need to convert it from your brain signals into something other people can connect with.\\nFirst of all, I\\u2019d like to get into a mindmap. You can use mindmapping software but I like to draw it all out on a piece of paper. I\\u2019ll literally dump all my ideas on the pieces of paper and translate that into the computer via software. That way, when I put it from paper to computer, it\\u2019ll go through another round of filtering by myself as I decide whether the idea is suitable or not. Oh yes, before I put it into the computer, I\\u2019ll sometimes take a day or two just to let the idea simmer in. I\\u2019ll give my subconscious time to make it better.\\nAnd when that\\u2019s done, start creating the product in your favorite modality. If you like to talk, do an audio recording or video recording. If you like to write, then write. When you\\u2019re done with capturing all your ideas \\u2013 this will be the raw file with which other people will help convert into other formats for you.\\nFor example, if you did a video or audio recording, when you\\u2019re done with it, hand it off to your team, let them transcribe it, let them put up the video effects, let them turn it into a blog post, article, etc. You don\\u2019t add any value into it by converting it into a different format. So don\\u2019t waste time on it.\\nIf you wrote it out, the next thing to do is to get it proofread. Clean it up and then have a voice over artiste record it into audio format, get someone to create the video slides and sync the audio together with the video slides.\\nDone.\\nThen proceed to compile the work into a product and you\\u2019re done. You, as the originator of the idea, need to be the overseer of the project. Whether everything is going exactly as you wanted. Always remember to keep the time schedule and deadlines. Otherwise, you\\u2019ll never get anything done.\",\n          \"Arduino Forum\\n>\\nUsing Arduino\\n>\\nMotors, Mechanics, and Power\\n(Moderator:\\nfabioc84\\n)\\n>\\nModel turntable with stepper motor?\\nPrint\\nGo Down\\nPages:\\n[1]\\nTopic: Model turntable with stepper motor?\\n(Read 4719 times)\\nprevious topic\\n-\\nnext topic\\nalcazar\\nGuest\\nModel turntable with stepper motor?\\nSep 29, 2013, 12:44 pm\\nHi, I was all set to buy a complete unit, but the people making it have discontinued it.\\nMy own knowledge of electronics stops at how a transistor works, sorry.......I AM 61.\\nSo...can anyone help me?\\nI'd like to be able to control a 7mm: 1 foot scale model railway turntable using a stepper motor to index it.\\nIS there a simplified system available, or am I looking at something way beyond me?\\nThanks for any help.\\nAWOL\\nGlobal Moderator\\nBrattain Member\\nPosts: 45,620\\nKarma: 1326\\n[add]\\nI don't think you connected the grounds, Dave.\\nRe: Model turntable with stepper motor?\\n#1\\nSep 29, 2013, 01:01 pm\\nWould a servo do the job?\\nA stepper will work, but without an encoder or limit switch or some external feedback (e.g. visual), a stepper has no idea where it was parked last time the power was switched off.\\n\\\"Pete, it's a fool looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart.\\\" Ulysses Everett McGill.\\nDo not\\nsend technical questions via personal messaging - they will be ignored.\\nscottyjr\\nGod Member\\nPosts: 559\\nKarma: 80\\n[add]\\nRe: Model turntable with stepper motor?\\n#2\\nSep 29, 2013, 01:15 pm\\nWelcome alcazar.

It uses a servo to rotate it and another servo to raise or lower a detector arm. If the arm is down the table keeps rotating until a metal tab touches the detector arm. At that point it is lined up. If it needs to move to another position the arm is lifted out of the way until the tab has passed.\\nThe rotation servo I'm using can turn a bit more than 180deg so the table has to turn backwards as well as forwards. But that means there is no need for slip rings for any of the wiring.\\nThe rotation servo is also the bearing for the rotation. All my stuff is visible above the table because the table will be off-scene, but I reckon it could also be hidden below.\\n...R\\nTwo or three hours spent thinking and reading documentation solves most programming problems.\\njackrae\\nEdison Member\\nPosts: 2,007\\nKarma: 165\\n[add]\\nArduino rocks\\nRe: Model turntable with stepper motor?\\n#5\\nSep 29, 2013, 07:53 pm\\nLast Edit\\n: Sep 29, 2013, 07:55 pm by jackrae\\nReason\\n: 1\\nThe above link gives the same (or similar) unit available in the UK\\nOr the same sort of thing from a commercial UK source\\nzoomkat\\nShannon Member\\nPosts: 13,882\\nKarma: 773\\n[add]\\nArduino rocks\\nRe: Model turntable with stepper motor?\\n#6\\nSep 30, 2013, 12:50 am\\nA Chinese supplier that say they ship world wide.\\nGoogle forum search: Use Google Search box in upper right side of this page.\\nWhy I like my 2005 Rio Yellow Honda S2000\\nscottyjr\\nGod Member\\nPosts: 559\\nKarma: 80\\n[add]\\nRe: Model turntable with stepper motor?\\n#7\\nSep 30, 2013, 01:24 pm\\nQuote\\nHow would I control that, get it to turn round, stop where I wanted it to, etc\\nYour turntable and thus the stepper motor must have a 'home' position i.e., a starting point. Finding that point would have to be done every time the system, specifically the microcontroller, is started; easy to do in the Setup function of your sketch. From that point its simply a matter of telling the device how many steps to take and in which direction. That motor as 4096 steps per revolution. Your sketch must keep track of where the motor's shaft is currently at in order to be able to tell it how many steps and which direction you want it to go to a new position. As mentioned before, others have written libraries for this device that will make it not necessary for you to write the code to control the motor. You can simply plug in the values to attain the position you desire.\\nMy 'home position sensor' of choice is an opto-interupter since that is a very accurate way of defining a position; think of how your desktop printer is able to position those tiny dots so accurately.\\n- Scotty\\nPrint\\nGo Up\\nPages:\\n[1]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer_found\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          false\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
