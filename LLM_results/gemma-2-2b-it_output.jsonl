{"question": "What are some of the benefits of investing in a holiday-let property according to Mark Baker and Lee from OnPoint Mortgages?", "output": "\nSome of the benefits include: You can still offset your full mortgage interest repayments against tax; you don't have to pay council tax on the property; you can avoid local business rates; and you can rent the property for longer than usual without any restrictions under HMRC regulations.

{"question": "What is the main issue with using two Smart Objects in Darken / Lighten mode for splitting dark and light halos in Photoshop?", "output": "\nThe problem lies in reversing the layer's order within the context of multiple Smart Filters being applied simultaneously. This causes incorrect results due to the sequential nature of SF operations where the second SF applies to the output from the first SF rather than directly onto the source material.

As a result, there isn't a straightforward solution without further modifications like creating separate masks per radius type or utilizing custom code specific to double USMs.\n", "answer": "The main issue with using two Smart Objects in Darken / Lighten mode for splitting dark and light halos in Photoshop is that the result is flawed.
